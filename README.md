Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on an underlying recommendation algorithm encapsulated within the system. The system operates on a database of users and a database of movies, where each user has a set of movie preferences and each movie has a set of attributes.

Program Structure
The system is organized into the following classes, each of which corresponds to a source (*.cpp) and header (*.h) file pair:

User: This class models a user in the system. It stores user attributes such as their email, name, and movie preferences.

Movie: This class models a movie in the system. It stores movie attributes such as its title, release year, genre, and rating.

UserDatabase: This class is a container for User objects. It provides functionalities to load user data from a file, retrieve a user by their email, and other user-related operations.

MovieDatabase: Similar to UserDatabase, this class is a container for Movie objects and provides functionalities to load movie data from a file, retrieve a movie by its ID, and other movie-related operations.

Recommender: This class encapsulates the recommendation algorithm of the system. It uses the UserDatabase and MovieDatabase to provide movie recommendations for a given user.

TreeMultimap: This class is a generic template that provides a mapping between keys and multiple values. It could be used to map a user to multiple movies or vice versa.

The main.cpp file is the entry point of the system. It initializes the UserDatabase and MovieDatabase with data from users.txt and movies.txt files, respectively, and uses the Recommender class to suggest movies to a given user.

Files
Below is a list of all the files in the project:

User.h and User.cpp
Movie.h and Movie.cpp
UserDatabase.h and UserDatabase.cpp
MovieDatabase.h and MovieDatabase.cpp
Recommender.h and Recommender.cpp
main.cpp
users.txt
movies.txt
treemm.h
How to Run
Compile all the *.cpp files together. The entry point is main.cpp. Make sure that the users.txt and movies.txt files are in the same directory as the compiled executable.

Once compiled, you can run the executable, and the system will start by loading user data and movie data, and it will then generate movie recommendations for a given user.

Note: As of now, the program's main function is hard-coded to find recommendations for the user "KabiL@aol.com". To change this, modify the user email in main.cpp.

Enjoy exploring the recommendations!

Future Work
The current state of the project leaves room for a few enhancements:

Implement user interactivity for inputting the user email.
Extend the program to ask users for their preferences, update the preferences, and provide new recommendations based on updated data.
Implement a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, you will need a C++ compiler that supports at least the C++11 standard. For the purpose of this instruction, we will be using g++, a widely used C++ compiler that comes with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

Compilation
To compile all the .cpp files together, navigate to the directory containing the source code files and run the following command:

g++ -std=c++11 -o MovieRecommender main.cpp User.cpp UserDatabase.cpp Movie.cpp MovieDatabase.cpp Recommender.cpp
This command compiles all the .cpp files and creates an executable named MovieRecommender.

Note: The -std=c++11 option is used to specify that the C++11 standard should be used for compilation.

Execution
To run the MovieRecommender executable, use the following command:

./MovieRecommender
About
MovieRecommender is a C++ console program for personalized movie recommendations. It analyzes user ratings to suggest movies aligned with user preferences, showcasing object-oriented design, data structures, and file I/O operations.
